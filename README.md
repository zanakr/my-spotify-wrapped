## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize Spotify listening habits over the past year using data requested from Spotify and additional information retrieved from the Spotify API. The project is divided into two main parts: Data Preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis with Visualizations.

### 1. Data Preparation

The goal of this notebook is to prepare the Spotify streaming history data for analysis.

**Key Steps:**
- Load and preprocess the streaming history data.
- Authenticate and connect to the Spotify API.
- Retrieve additional information for tracks, artists, and audio features.
- Merge the additional data with the original dataset for a comprehensive view.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The objective of this notebook is to delve into the Spotify listening data and answer various questions regarding listening habits. Key focus areas include:

#### Listening Patterns

- **Total Listening Time:** Analyzing the total duration of music and podcast consumption over the year.
- **Monthly Listening Analysis:** Investigating the monthly distribution of listening time on Spotify.
- **Weekly Listening Analysis:** Examining patterns of music consumption throughout the week, including weekends.
- **Daily Listening Analysis:** Understanding Spotify usage patterns across different times of the day.

#### Content Analysis

- **Content Proportion:** Determining the proportion of music versus podcasts in the listening history.
- **Top Content:** Identifying top podcasts, most listened-to artists, and top tracks of the year.

#### Genre Analysis

- **Top Genres:** Exploring the most popular genres based on listening behavior.

By working through these notebooks, you will gain insights into personal listening habits, preferences, and overall music and podcast consumption trends over the past year.
